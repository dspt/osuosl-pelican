The Oregon State University Open Source Lab was recently featured in a Network
World online story about really cool university computer network labs. This is a
great honor for us, and we are glad to be in such good company. Some of the
highlights of the OSUOSL included in the list were our hosting of projects such
as the `Linux Kernel`_, `Drupal`_, the `Linux Foundation`_, our development work
on the `Oregon Virtual School District`_, and our annual
`Government Open Source Conference`_.
