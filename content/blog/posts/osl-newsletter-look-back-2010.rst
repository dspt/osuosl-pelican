We’ve had plenty of good things happening at the OSL since we brought your our
last newsletter, and as we’re busy gearing up for 2011 we wanted to take a few
moments to share our good news with the community.

First, the best news: We’re Hiring!
-----------------------------------

The OSL is hiring for a full-time software developer who will analyze, design,
and test software code for `Ganeti Web Manager`_, the
`Protein Geometry Database`__ and several other
`homegrown Open Source Lab projects`_. For more details on the position and
instructions on how to apply, check out the `Analyst Programmer`_ role on the
Oregon State University Jobs page.

Wrapping our Sixth GOSCON
-------------------------

Producing the `Government Open Source Conference`_ has been a six year labor of
love for the OSL team and, in particular, `Deborah Bryant`_, our Public Sector
Communities Manager. We were excited that GOSCON returned to Oregon for its
sixth instance, and even more excited when the City of Portland declared the
week of the conference "`Open Source in Government Week`_." Attendees were
treated to `more than twenty talks`_ on all aspects of the use of open source in
government, from agency use cases to panels on how to meet the challenges of
open government initiatives. You can find a full `post-conference write up`_ on
the GOSCON website and stay tuned to all things GOSCON by following
`@goscon on Twitter`_.

We've posted many of the slide sets from the conference presentations, and
will be adding more as we continue to receive them from speakers. Stay tuned for
an announcement that videos from the sessions are available, though you can
already enjoy some `video interviews`_ with speakers and attendees from
`OpenAffairs`_. You can also check out talks from the world's first
`IgniteGov on YouTube`_, and you might be interested in
`Alex Howard's O'Reilly Radar write up`_ on the talk "Why middleware is the key
to a successful gov 2.0" from Portland's very own `CivicApps contest winner`_
and `Code for America Fellow`_, Max Ogden.

Developer News
--------------

Our developer team has been hard at work adding new features to
`Ganeti Web Manager`_, putting out the `0.4 release on December 22nd`_. New
features include improvements to the caching system, SSH key feeds, import tools
and more. You can learn more about Ganeti Web Manager's permissions system on
the blog of our Lead Developer, Peter Krenesky. For details on how the OSL uses
Google's `Ganeti`_ to manage our clusters, check out the `writings`_ from our
Lead Systems Administrator/Architect, Lance Albertson.

We've also created a Twitter stream for Ganeti Web Manager news,
`@ganetiwebmgr`_. Follow us for more news and announcements about upcoming GWM
talks.

In addition to working on Ganeti Web Manager, Peter and our team of student
developers have been hard at work on a new tool for researchers, the
`Protein Geometry Database`_. The PGD gives researchers robust and
straightforward ability to analyze 16,000 non-redundant protein chains, their
backbone conformation and geometry, as well as the relationships between them.
You can learn more about the academic uses and the development process for the
PGD in one of our recent news articles, or check out the technical documentation
and source code at http://code.osuosl.org/projects/pgd.

Google's Open Source Programs for Students
------------------------------------------

The OSL has been a proud participant in Google's open source programs for
students since 2006, our first year participating in `Google Summer of Code`_.
This year we had `two students successfully complete their projects`_, both of
them working on `Pydra`_, a distributed and parallel computing framework for
Python. Once again, one our student employees mentored for the OSL this year,
with Corbin Simpson working with Bartosz Wroblewski on
`Implementing Map Reduce in Pydra`_. Brian Martin worked with Peter on a
`whole wishlist of features for Pydra's 1.0 release`_. Congratulations to
Bartosz and Brian, and many thanks to them for working with us for Google Summer
of Code 2010.

In addition to our participation in GSoC, we were
`one of twenty mentoring organizations`_ selected to participate in Google's
second contest to get pre-university students involved in open source,
`Google Code-in`_. We're less than seven days away from the contest closing, and
we've been incredibly pleased with our results: more than 30 tasks have been
completed to improve Ganeti Web Manager, ranging from bug fixes, creating new
features to improvements to the user interface. We've published an interview
with one of our most prolific GCI students, Piotr, for your further reading
pleasure. You might also want to read the post from our Project Manager, Greg
Lund-Chaix, on the valuable experience provided to students participating in the
contest.

Many thanks to Google and their `Open Source Team`_ for sponsoring these great
programs!

  Robbins, creator of Gentoo Linux
* `The Genomics Standards Consortium`_, an open-membership, international
  working body to promote mechanisms that standardize the description of genomes
  and the exchange and integration of genomic data
* `Mageia`_, a fork of Mandriva Linux, supported by a not-for-profit
  organization of recognized and elected contributors
* `OAGITM`_, the Oregon Association of Government IT Management, a statewide
  association of information technology managers for City, County, State, and
  other affiliated government agencies within Oregon

The OSL and Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software
------------------------------------------------------

We also welcomed two new humanitarian focused communities to the OSL family,
`CrisisCommons`_ and the `Sahana Foundation`_. CrisisCommons is a group of
individuals collaborating on a commons-based approach to disaster relief and
crisis management, most notably through their `CrisisCamp events`_.
CrisisCommons announced the move of their infrastructure to the OSL as part of
their `receipt of a $1.2M grant from the Sloan Foundation`_.

The Sahana project was initiated by volunteers in the Sri Lankan FOSS
development community to help their fellow countrymen and countrywomen affected
during the 2004 Asian Tsunami in December 2004. Since its inception, Sahana has
been rewritten as a set of modular disaster management tools, including a
Missing Person Registry, an Inventory Management application and a Volunteer
Coordination system.

You can read more about Sahana and two other OSL hosted Humanitarian FOSS
communities, `OpenMRS`_ and `TriSano`_, in the December issue of the Open Source
Business Resource magazine on `Humanitarian Open Source`_. `Leslie Hawthorn`_,
our Open Source Outreach Manager, guest edited the issue.
