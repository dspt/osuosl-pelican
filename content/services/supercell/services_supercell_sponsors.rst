Facebook is a social utility that helps over 500 million people around the world
communicate more efficiently with their friends, family and coworkers. The site
has been built on common open source software such as Linux, Apache, MySQL, and
PHP. Over the past few years, the company has developed a number of open source
infrastructure technologies to support the site's growth including HipHop for
PHP, Cassandra, Hive, Scribe, and Thrift. Facebook engineers actively contribute
and participate in various open source projects, especially around the Apache
Hadoop ecosystem, developing technologies that facilitate the sharing of
information through the social graph.

The creation of Supercell was made possible by a generous monetary and hardware
donation from `Facebook`_ and their `Open Source Team`_.
