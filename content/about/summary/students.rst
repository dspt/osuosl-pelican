Students are an integral part of the Oregon State University Open Source Lab.
Students are highly involved in all our development and hosting activities,
working in developer and system administrator positions.

`Student Stories`_
------------------
Working on open source projects not only gives our students a great opportunity
to use, understand and contribute to new technologies, but also puts their work
out in the open where it can be seen and appreciated by users, developers and
potential employers. For an idea of some of the projects OSL student employees
have worked on, check out our `student stories`_.

`Open Source on Campus`_
------------------------
The OSU Open Source Lab is not the only location on campus where students are
exposed to open source software and practices. The `Open Source Education Lab`_
and `Linux User Group`_ are both very active on campus and give students
the opportunity to interact with other like-minded individuals, learn new things
and display the benefits of open source to the campus community and beyond.
Students also use open source as part of the computer science curriculum, from
digging into Linux source for an operating systems class to learning about
communities, submitting patches and more in Tim Budd's open source elective
course. By working with open source at Oregon State University, students are
able to learn skills that will benefit them greatly in their careers. To learn
more, please see `Open Source at OSU`_.

Work Experience
---------------
Working at the OSU Open Source Lab provides students with an excellent
opportunity to gain work experience. These are not your typical student
positions. Students work closely with our customers and hosted clients to
provide professional development and hosting services. Ever wanted to work
closely with developers from some of the most prominent open source projects in
the world? The OSU Open Source Lab provides a unique opportunity for students to
do just that.
