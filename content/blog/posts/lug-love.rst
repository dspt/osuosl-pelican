he Oregon State University Linux Users Group (`LUG`_) exists to promote free and
open source software on campus. Its members and moderators turn to events like
`OSCON`_ to find support from premier open source affiliates to help boost the
group’s reputability at Oregon State University, and last week some OSU Open
Source Lab (`OSL`_) students also LUG members were treated to mass donations.

An incredible 23 organizations and companies listed below opened their booths
and handed the students boxes of t-shirts, books and other great gifts to help
the LUG’s development this coming year.

“At the start of the school year, you have a bunch of freshmen coming in being
pulled left and right by all these different organizations,” said Emily Dunham,
a sophomore developer at the OSL and LUG member. “We want to give the students
more encouragement to try the Linux Users Group; see if getting involved with
open source is something that interests them. We picked up quite a bit of stuff
in that interest.”

While LUG moderators will use t-shirts, stickers and the like to entice new
members and create an eventful atmosphere during meetings, they also will
utilize the large quantities of books and magazines organizations provided for
educational means. No Starch Press, for example, donated critical material like
How Linux Works, Book of Inkscape, Essential Blender and Ubuntu for Non-Geeks.
MongoDB, ARIN, SourceGear and Linux Magazine also gave armfuls of useful
resources.

“We so sincerely appreciate their commitment to helping our assistance to the
community,” Dunham said. “These aren’t necessarily the biggest companies and
don’t necessarily have a lot of stuff to give away, and yet they shared with us
what they thought would help.”

The moderators are excited about this upcoming year. They hope to reenergize the
LUG, and the donations will certainly play a major role in doing so.
