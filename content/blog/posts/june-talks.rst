Summer conference season is upon us, and employees of the OSL will be giving
several talks. Kicking off June's festivities, `Leslie Hawthorn`_ will be
discussing "Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software: Saving the World One Bit
at a Time" at `Southeast LinuxFest`_. The conference runs from June 10-12 in
Spartanburg, South Carolina, and Leslie will be speaking this Friday, June 10th.

If you find yourself in Portland, Oregon for `Open Source Bridge`_, you'll hear
from all our technical staff at the conference. `Tim Harder`_ will be covering
`OSWALD: Lessons from and for the Open Hardware Movement`_. `Lance Albertson`_
and `Peter Krenesky`_ will be giving a tutorial talk on
`Hands-on Virtualization with Ganeti`_. Open Source Bridge runs June 21-24th.

We're also gearing up for `OSCON 2011`_, but that's a story for July. We hope to
see you at Southeast LinuxFest, Open Source Bridge or both!
