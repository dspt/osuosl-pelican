`TeachEngineering`_ is a digital library of over 800 K-12 engineering lessons
and hands-on activities. The lesson materials in TeachEngineering are developed
by a variety of organizations and programs and are made available free-of-charge
to educators.

The Oregon State University Open Source Lab is proud to provide hosting and
system administration for the TeachEngineering website and development servers.
TeachEngineering has become another great example of the use of open source at
OSU.

Development of the collection was motivated by the following:

* To consolidate and make searchable a large amount of excellent curriculum that
  was previously dispersed over various organizations, and which was stored in
  different formats and different document structures.
* All learning materials in TeachEngineering use engineering as the vehicle to
  study math and science. As such, TeachEngineering is meant to promote the use
  of engineering as a means for learning in K-12 environments.
* TeachEngineering lessons and exercises are structured to fit teaching K-12
  students and to provide K-12 science and math teachers with suitable and
  hands-on curriculum at no cost except their effort having to master and
  improve it. With this approach the collection developers hope to support
  teachers and students in poorer schools and districts.
* All teaching materials in TeachEngineering are 'aligned' with the mathematics,
  science and technology K-12 educational standards of all U.S. states as well
  as with the standards formulated by a variety of nongovernmental national
  standard bodies. This should make it easier for teachers to find curriculum
  that fits the standards to which they must teach.

Besides its HTML interface targeted at people, TeachEngineering both exposes and
uses a variety of Web services. Among these are services to expose its
collection's metadata to other collections―- try, for example, a search for the
term 'spaghetti' in the `National Science Digital Library`_ ―and services from
third-party providers that help with the automatic alignment of curriculum and
standards.

The collection and its software infrastructure are housed at Oregon State
University's Open Source Lab and are almost entirely developed and implemented
using open source software tools. Visit http://www.teachengineering.org for more
information.
