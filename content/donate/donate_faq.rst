.. _How are you associated with Oregon State University?:

**How are you associated with Oregon State University?**

The Open Source Lab is part of Network Services at Oregon State University. Our
staff are all OSU employees, and our student employees are all OSU students. We
receive many benefits from being a part of the University including office
space, data center space, infrastructure, and a close tie to students who are
interested in working with open source. We receive very little direct funding
from the University, which is why we rely on external donations for our
operations.


.. _Are donations tax deductible?:

**Are donations tax deductible?**

The OSU Foundation is an IRS 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation, which provides
many donors a tax advantage. Please contact your account or the OSU Foundation
directly if you have questions about your eligibility.


.. _What is the OSU Foundation?:

**What is the OSU Foundation?**

The OSU Foundation handles all donations for Oregon State University. For more
information on the OSU Foundation, visit their website at
http://osufoundation.org


.. _I work for a company that has a donation matching program, how can I get
   them to match my donation to the OSUOSL?:

**I work for a company that has a donation matching program, how can I get them
to match my donation to the OSUOSL?**

Many corporations have programs which will match donations to educational
institutions. The OSU Foundation has instructions for many companies listed
here:

https://osufoundation.org/giving/company_match.htm

If you don't find your employer in that list, or have further questions, please
contact your employer or the OSU Foundation directly to find out if your
donation is eligible for a matching program.


.. _How much money are you trying to raise?:

**How much money are you trying to raise?**

Our annual expenses are roughly $1 million. Our goal is to raise at least enough
to cover those expenses. The exact amount we need to cover with donations varies
based on paid development work and grant-supported funding we receive. Any
additional funding beyond what we need to operate during this fiscal year will
go towards expenses beyond the current fiscal year.


.. _What will you use my donation for?:

**What will you use my donation for?**

Many of the services we provide for open source projects are provided for
no-cost. We rely on donations to cover the expenses we incur providing these
valuable services. Below, you can find a pie chart giving a general idea of our
budget for the 2009-2010 fiscal year.

Below are a few examples of where we have spent money in the past year and some
of our plans for future spending.

**Servers**: we purchased three FTP servers to upgrade the space and download
capacity of our mirroring infrastructure. We are now hosting one download mirror
in Corvallis, one in Chicago, and one in New York (moving from Atlanta).

**Bandwidth**: We currently have a 10Gbit/sec connection out to the Internet
from Corvallis. Our two remote FTP servers are hosted by TDS Telecom and are
each allocated roughly 300Mbits/sec. This bandwidth allows us to support a large
number of hosted projects as well as providing mirroring/download services for
many Linux distributions and other open source applications. Our FTP mirrors
serve over 6 terabytes of data per day.

**Virtualization**: Many of the projects we host are on virtual servers. Our
virtualization offering has grown so much since it's inception that we recently
deployed a new virtualization cluster which will help us scale more easily to
provide stable virtual servers to our hosted projects. Our new deployment
requires the purchase of servers, and RAM and hard drives to add to servers that
have been donated.

**Databases**: Many of our hosted projects need an SQL database as part of their
infrastructure. We have a number of servers running MySQL and PostgreSQL which
we make available to our hosted projects. As the need for databases continues to
increase, we will need to purchase more servers to continue providing this
service.


.. _What projects do you support?:

**What projects do you support?**
The OSUOSL supports a large number of growing, high-impact open source
communities. This includes the Apache Software Foundation, the Linux Foundation,
Drupal, and many others. For a full list, please see
http://osuosl.org/services/hosting/communities


.. _How is the OSUOSL run?:

**How is the OSUOSL run?**

We have five full-time staff members and we employ about a dozen students at any
given time. The full-time staff consists of:

- An Operations Manager to oversee all activities of the lab,
- A Public Sector Communities Manager to advocate and create government
  collaboration with open source and to lead OSUOSL's annual GOSCON conference,
- A Project Manager to lead development on the ORVSD project,
- A Lead Software Engineer to serve as our lead developer and to oversee work
  done by our student developers,
- A Systems Administrator and Architect to design and manage our hosting
  infrastructure, and to oversee work done by our student system administrators.


The Operations Manager works closely with the OSUOSL Advisory Council, a group
of experts from open source projects and industry, for suggestions and advice on
opportunies and direction for the lab. The list of all Advisory Council members
can be found at http://osuosl.org/advisors


.. _What will happen if you don't meet your fund raising goal?:

**What will happen if you don't meet your fund raising goal?**

Our foremost goal is to continue to provide world-class hosting services to open
source projects. Should we fail to meet our fund raising target, we will be
forced to re-evaluate our priorities and eliminate some of the lab's activities.
This decision, should it need to be made, will be discussed with the OSUOSL
Advisory Council, and decided upon with OSU leadership.


.. _Who else is supporting the OSUOSL financially?:

**Who else is supporting the OSUOSL financially?**

The OSUOSL has many donors who generously support our efforts. Members of the
OSL Alliance program are those who have given at least $10,000 annually. The
full list of OSL Alliance members is available at http://osuosl.org/members We
also receive support from many individuals, smaller companies and projects. Our
Friends of the OSL program includes all of those donors, and they are listed
here: http://osuosl.org/friends/members

the OSL program, please include that information in the comments box on the
donation form. If you do not want your name to appear on our site, simply leave
the comments empty, or enter "I do not wish to be listed on your website" in the

How do I request a particular size or other details?**

Please use the comments box on the donation form to specify your T-shirt size if
you are requesting a shirt. If you are requesting a hat or beer mug, simply
state as much in the comments form. There is no need to specify hat size as they
are adjustable “one size fits most”. We do our best to ship gifts out in a
timely manner, however, this can sometimes take up to 2-3 weeks after your
donation was processed.
