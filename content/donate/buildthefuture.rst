**The Open Source Lab has been driving the growth of open source culture around
the world since 2003.**

The lab began by hosting projects like `Drupal`_ and Mozilla Firefox to success,
and continues to support promising projects and communities. In house, OSL staff
are developing new tools to advance open source software with open source
solutions. And with an expanding focus on student employment, the lab is
training a new generation of open source innovators. **All of these
contributions are enhanced by the lab’s commitment to building bridges between
leaders in government, education and advocacy and the open source community.**

The OSL has used the last 10 years to build a strong foundation of projects,
people and ideas that are shaping the progress of the open source community.
Now, the lab is taking the lead with key objectives to build an even *stronger*
future. Through **education**, **outreach** and **research & infrastructure**
development, the OSL will ensure open source technologies continue to advance
well into the future.

Education
---------

Student employees gain professional experience at the OSL that they bring to
careers in the technical industry. **By increasing the number of students**
we’re sending into the industry with a passion for open source software and a
full set of professional skills, the OSL is filling the skills gap and ensuring
a rich future for open source technologies.

Outreach
--------

Open source is a unique and essential model because it puts *community* at the
forefront. Community-driven innovation doesn’t happen in a vacuum - and that’s
why promoting *collaboration, accessibility* and *transparency* is one of the
lab’s top priorities. We’re working to build a future that serves the core open
source mission: connecting people and software to address **real-world** issues.

Research & Infrastructure
-------------------------

The OSL takes a dual approach to open source advancement by **offering hosting
and support resources** to growing projects and developing in-house tools that
bolster the open source community. By strengthening our internal infrastructure,
the lab will expand its hosting and development capabilities to make an even
*greater* impact.
