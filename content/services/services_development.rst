The Oregon State University Open Source Lab's talented development staff and
student employees develop tools that help projects work more efficiently and
offer open source solutions to meet the needs of organizations on the community,
state and global levels.


Development Projects
--------------------

Our development solutions have served many open source projects as well as
educational and government organizations looking to implement or extend open
source software to meet their needs. Here are a few recent projects the OSL has
worked on:


`Ganeti Web Manager`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ganeti Web Manager (GWM) is a Web application developed at the OSL that allows
administrators and clients access to administer and use Google’s open source
cloud infrastructure. With a caching system designed to scale to many thousands
of virtual machines without decreasing performance, GWM makes private cluster
management for administrators truly simple.

`Oregon Virtual School District`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Oregon Virtual School District is a program led by the Oregon Department of
Education that, in cooperation with a consortium of virtual learning providers
throughout the state, seeks to increase access and availability of online
learning and teaching resources free of charge to the people of Oregon. Oregon
State University is providing hosting and development resources for the project.

`Protein Geometry Database`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Protein Geometry Database (PGD) was developed by the OSU Open Source Lab for
use by researchers in OSU's biochemistry department. PGD provides an online
search tool used to mine protein conformational space with a user-friendly but
surprisingly flexible graphical interface.

`TriSano`_
~~~~~~~~~~

TriSano™ is an open source, citizen-focused surveillance and outbreak management
system for infectious disease, environmental hazards and bioterrorism attacks.
It allows local, state and federal entities to track, control and ultimately
prevent illness and death. OSL students have done development on the Trisano
project while working closely with the project's development team.

`One Laptop Per Child`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OSL development staff have worked on multiple aspects of the One Laptop Per
Child (OLPC) and Sugar projects. Two of the larger projects the OSL has worked
on in relation to the OLPC are the media player and printing support.
Collaboration and interaction are a huge focus for the OLPC project, which seeks
to provide inexpensive laptops to children in developing countries around the
world. Because the laptops are able to record video with a built-in webcam,
there was need for a media player. In partnership with Real, the Open Source Lab
offered to take on this project. The software to fill this void is the media
player activity for Sugar, the user environment for the OLPC project. The
activity is a full-fledged media player, tailored specifically to fit within the
human interface guidelines that the Sugar team has provided. The media player
was created using Python bindings for the Helix DNA Client. It has been designed
to provide the best media experience possible while maintaining a level of
simplicity that children all around the world will be able to handle.

`Pydra`_
~~~~~~~~

Pydra is a distributed and parallel computing framework for Python. Pydra aims
to provide an easy-to-use framework for writing and running distributed programs
for developers, and an easy-to-manage cluster for the administrators.

Project Funding
---------------

The majority of our development projects are funded through donations we receive
from both the OSL Alliance and the `Friends of the OSL`_ programs. In certain
cases, we have an agreement in place and charge for our development services.
This is especially true for educational institutions and state and local
government agencies looking for help developing open source software.
