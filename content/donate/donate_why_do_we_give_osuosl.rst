The OSL collaborates with people and companies around the world. As a result,
the lab has active supporters that range from corporate giants to individuals
who love open source.

Our partnership with Google has resulted in contributions totaling $1.9 million
since 2005. This confidence in the lab’s potential as an investment in the
future of open source has helped us expand our impact and improve our hosting
and development services using new, collaborative strategies. Below are words
from Google’s Chris DiBona and two of our other supporters on why they are
excited about the opportunity to contribute to the OSL’s mission.

Chris DiBona Google Director of Open Source *“Oregon State’s Open Source Lab
provides world-class services that enable collaboration among millions of users
globally. Google is proud to continue its support of such an innovative
program.”*

Angela Byron ("webchick") Acquia Director, Community Development *"The OSU Open
Source Lab has been instrumental in the growth and stability of drupal.org, the
official website and development collaboration hub for the Drupal content
management platform. When we outgrew our old hosting back in 2005, OSL
graciously stepped in to provide us with top-notch hosting facilities and
skilled systems administrators, always willing to share their knowledge and
expertise. OSL has kept our home stable and running smoothly to this very day,
despite our community exploding to almost triple its size since when we began
our relationship, and increased system requirements from our development
activity. I'm extremely proud to donate to the OSL to support the amazing work
they do, not just in hosting and supporting the infrastructure for Drupal, but
for many other key open source projects and communities. Rock on!"*

John Hawley ("Warthog9") Red Hat Senior Software Engineer *"I donate to OSUOSL
because they provide one of the most important services the open source
community can have: hosting. It's great that our code is Free (as in speech),
but hosting is Free (as in beer). I give to make sure that our future is secure
and that they don't turn my boxes off by mistake."* **[Ed. note: We would never
do that!]**
