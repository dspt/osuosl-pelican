The OSUOSL Heads to LinuxCon North America 2011 Next Week

The entire `OSU Open Source Lab`_ team will be catching a ride on the `Tux Bus`_
next Monday, headed to Vancouver, B.C. and `LinuxCon North America 2011`_. We're
very excited to be leading all the sessions for the brand new
`Linux Learners Day`_, a full day of talks geared to students. The schedule
includes:

* Fundamentals of Open Source Development
* Linux Basics
* Introduction to Python
* Embedded Systems
* Careers in Open Source

Linux Learners Day is one of the many ways the `Linux Foundation`_ supports
students in pursuit of future careers in the Linux arena. Other efforts include
`Linux Training Scholarships`_, with the first round of scholarship recipients
announced just yesterday.

We'll also be at LinuxCon the rest of the week to enjoy the sessions and the
company of our fellow Linux and open source enthusiasts. While we're looking
forward to many of the talks, we're particularly looking forward to our very own
`Lance Albertson`_ presenting on `Hosting Open Source Projects at the OSUOSL`_.

`Registration`_ is still open for Linux Learners Day and LinuxCon, so if you
haven't made arrangements to join us, there's still time to do so. Hope to see
you in Vancouver!
