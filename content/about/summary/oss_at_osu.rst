Students at Oregon State University are provided a number of opportunities to
interact with open source software and communities. While the Open Source Lab
provides direct ties to a number of open source projects, open source is also
used in computer science courses, and there are multiple student groups which
help to promote open source on campus.

`Linux Users Group`_

The `OSU LUG`_ meets weekly to discuss Linux and open source issues, talk about
new technologies and host speakers to introduce the group to various topics
around Linux. The LUG puts on events such as "installfests" where LUG members
help others install Linux on their systems. Famous for antics such as the
`Firefox Crop Circle`_ (`Google Maps image`_), the LUG is an exciting
student-run group to get involved with. Picture from http://photos.charkbot.com/

`Open Source Education Lab`_
----------------------------

The OSEL (not to be confused with the OSL) is a student organization on campus
that has helped organize events, create newsletters and interact with people
both on and off campus to advocate open source. In the past, the OSEL had
members from various parts of campus including the Open Source Lab, the Linux
Users Group and the College of Engineering. While not currently active, the OSEL
will soon be relaunched with new opportunities to connect students and community
members with open source ideas. More information about the OSEL is available at
their `website`_.

**Open Source in the Curriculum**

Open source is a growing part of the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science
program. A number of courses are developed around open source software.
`BeaverSource`_ is an online community where OSU students, faculty and staff can
create development sites for open source projects and interact with each other
through wikis, forums, blogs and other common social networking technologies.
The EECS department has also developed a small hardware device which runs Linux
and provides students the opportunity to interact with both the hardware and
software in a hands-on manner. Curriculum has been developed for courses
throughout students' time at OSU, including robotics, networking, operating
systems and computer graphics. More information about the learning device is
available at the `project website`_. There is also a `special topics course`_
specifically on open source software.
